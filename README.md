**What is this plugin?** \
AntiPopup is a plugin aiming to remove chat reporting system entirely using packets. It also has unique feature - blocks the new annoying popup (below) even if your server doesn't enforce chat reporting (please don't enforce it). \
My plugin is also the safest to use, chance of breaking a different plugin is unlikely, I'd even say impossible. Note that some plugins might break it, report that to me. \

**How to install?**\
Plug and play, nothing else for you to do. \
Optionally you can run **antipopup setup** in console, recommended. \
If you use viaversion on bungeecord install AntiPopup ViaVersion addon.

**Commands** \
**antipopup setup** - Disables **enforce-secure-profile** in server.properties (console only). \
**antipopup reload** - Reloads configuration.

**Faq** \
Q: What if my server runs an older version? \
A: If you use viaversion and antipopup, 1.19.1+ players will not see popup. \
Q: Will it work with ViaFabric? \
A: Popup will be shown for 1.19.2 clients spoofing to 1.19, nothing I can fix on my side.
